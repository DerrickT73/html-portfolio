<p><b>I'm</b>  your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, slinging webs of creative coding your way.
I have a background in nursing, law, and teaching English. I'm coming to your neighborhood to join the 
next creative super web coding team. Although I'm not the man of steel; I am a super team player.
My best webs are in HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap. I'm want to use all my past knowledge in other feilds 
and fuse it into coding webs of creativity.</p>
